# Advent of Code

This repository demonstrates my solution to each
[advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) exercises.
I will update towards the end of each day, following
the guidelines that we should not share solutions
before the score board for each day is complete.

## [2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/)

I have used the [Go](https://golang.org) language
as I find this the most intuitive and easy to learn
programming language of modern times :).
